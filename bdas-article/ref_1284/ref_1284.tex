\begin{abstract}
The amounts of data being processed today are enormous and they require specialized systems 
to store them, access them and do computations. Therefore, a number of NoSql databases and 
big data platforms were built to address this problem. They usually lack of transaction 
support which feature atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability and at the same time 
they are distributed, scalable, and fault tolerant. In this paper we present a novel 
transaction processing framework based on Cassandra storage model. It uses Paxos protocol 
to provide atomicity and consistency of transactions and Cassandra specific read and write 
paths improvements to provide read committed isolation level and durability. Unlike built-in 
Light Weight Transactions (LWT) support in Cassandra, our algorithm can span multiple data 
partitions and provides tunable contention control. We verified correctness and efficiency 
both theoretically and by executing tests over different workloads. The results presented 
in this paper prove the usability and robustness of the designed system.

\section{Introduction}
Big Data is the term used for describing sets of increasing volumes of data, which do not fit 
in a single machine. There are many sources of Big Data, such as system logs, user website 
clicks, financial transactions, weather measurements, data from Internet of Things, and many others.

NoSql databases were created to support storing Big Data and provide the means to analyze it. 
Databases differ in a ways they represent the data, but the key principle remains the same: 
store the data for future analysis. NoSql databases span over hundreds, even thousands servers 
located in different various physical locations and are designed to overcome individual node 
failures and network partitions. They provide guarantees for certain behaviour in face of such
problems which usually means they eventually achieve the consistency of data at some point.

Properties of relational databases, such as ACID compliant transactions are usually sacrificed 
for availability, scalability and fault tolerance. Multi-partition transactions facilitate 
the work of developers, since they provide clear reasoning about sets of modifications of the data. 
These transactions do not exist in Cassandra, but also other NoSql databases lack proper 
transactions support.
