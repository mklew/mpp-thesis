Summary of algorithm
\mpt algorithm supports multi partition transactions with read-committed isolation. Transactions has been achieved by means of distributed consensus provided by paxos algorithm and other components required for isolation and conflict resolution. Extended paxos proceeds only when quorum of each replica group agree on phase of algorithm. At its core it is still paxos, but with higher number of constraints which guarantee atomicity and isolation of whole transaction spanning many partitions.
