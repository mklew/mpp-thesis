% Porównanie wielkości tokenów na JVM.
In case of \emph{JVM} tokens are of type \emph{long} which occupies 8 bytes of memory. Keys are not restricted by any type, thus for example a key can be a 100 character long string which requires around $232$ bytes\footnote{exact size depends on \emph{JVM} options used}. Size of the key is then 29 times size of a token. Complex keys can have even bigger size.

The subject of the thesis is multi-partition transactions in Cassandra. 
The goal of the thesis is to design, implement, test, verify and analyze results of the new algorithm, which supports such transactions. The primary requirement for the algorithm is scalability and lack of single point of failure. This paper presents description of the algorithm, its implementation in Cassandra, and analysis of the results. Moreover, the paper includes concepts used in distributed databases, different algorithms to implement relational and distributed transactions, related work, and detailed description of Cassandra.
