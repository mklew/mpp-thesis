Testing
 Chapter is focused on explaining theory behind testing that gives high certainty about correctness of algorithm and its implementation.  Iâ€™ve run many tests on different levels that had to verify if implementation is correct, but what is more important if new multi partition paxos algorithm delivers its promise. 
Paxos has been proven formally, whereas algorithm developed during this research has been proven to work in practice for all written tests. For some, it might not be enough, but writing a formal proof is a complex task which would require further research.


Unit testing
Many unit tests were written to test particular functionality in isolation. 


TODO description...


Cluster tests
* Feature tests - single features tested on cluster
* Full tests - TODO main part of testing
* Tell about using CCM


Full tests


Counters - basic building block for different tests


Testing for rollback


Testing for read repair
Read has to be consistent when leader crashes


Testing for concurrent transactions
Counters and executors which increment them. Number of incrementations has to be equal to successful transactions


Testing for independent transactions


Performance tests
TODO how to test performance
