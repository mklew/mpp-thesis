\section{Multiple partitions}\label{sec:mpp:requirements}

\lwt supports many instances of paxos protocol at any given time, which do not interfere with each other, unless the same partition keys are considered. \lwt instances for different keys do not overlap nor stall each other.
\mpt supports many instances as well, but a single instance of \mpt might overlap with different instance of \mpt, in which case such instances are considered conflicting. 

\lwt identifies \emph{paxos round} by a partition key. The key difference to \lwt is that \mpt instance is associated with many keys, thus instance of \mpt cannot be identified by a partition key. 
Distinction between \paxos rounds in \mpt is troublesome because it is not obvious how to reflect a set of different keys as a single round identifier.
\label{sec:mpp:requirements:identifyRound}

\lwt is for a single partition, therefore it represents a single operation. As such, operation itself is a
\emph{transaction}. Data for that transaction are passed within operation itself, thus data do not have to be stored
 for the duration of the transaction, because it exists only in memory while \lwt transaction executes.
On the other hand, \mpt supports many operations within a transaction. Therefore operations with data have to be stored for the duration of the transaction. Moreover, storage has to be private for the transaction in order to provide isolation.
