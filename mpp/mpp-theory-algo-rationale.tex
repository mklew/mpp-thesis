\section{The rationale}
The \mpp algorithm is designed for distributed databases with token ring architecture,
which uses \emph{keys} to lookup replicated data in the cluster. However, there are no strict restrictions, thus the algorithm potentially supports any distributed database.

\mpp supports multi-partition operations.
\mpp supports transactions with read-committed isolation level. 
\mpp supports transactions that are atomic and durable.
\mpp is resilient to network partitions. In terms of \emph{CAP} \cite{Brewer:2012ba} it uses \emph{AP}
\mpp is eventually consistent (\ref{sec:theory:eventualConsistency}). 

Comparison of \mpp to \lwt is shown at fig. \ref{fig:mppVsLwt}.

%MPPaxos provides serializable transactions that span multiple tokens on token ring. Provides transactions which are isolated from each other. Transactions that are atomic and durable.
%Consistency is eventual for all nodes, but reads are always consistent as long as quorum of nodes is considered. This is the same as in LWT.
