\section{Rationale}
The \mpt algorithm is designed for distributed databases with token ring architecture,
which uses \emph{keys} to lookup replicated data in the cluster. Its key features are: \begin{enumerate*}[label=\alph*)]
\item supports multi-partition operations,
\item supports transactions with read-committed isolation level,
\item supports transactions that are atomic and durable,
\item is resilient to network partitions. In terms of \emph{CAP} \cite{Brewer:2012ba} it uses \emph{AP}.
\end{enumerate*}
