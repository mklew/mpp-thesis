\section{Transaction Log}
\label{sec:mpp:transactionLog}
\emph{Transaction Log} is a similar concept to \emph{Transaction Index}. It also has to be present at each node in the cluster. Its responsibility is to record committed and rolled back transactions. \emph{Transaction Index} changes frequently, because transactions are registered in it and removed on rollback. Since \emph{transaction index} is the only way to find Paxos State and since transactions are removed from index once are finished, we need a log that has information whether transaction is committed or not. It has to support following operations:
\begin{description}
\item[\code{addAsCommitted (transaction id)}] -- records committed transaction
\item[\code{addAsRolledBack (transaction id)}] -- records rolled back transaction
\item[\code{findTransaction(transaction id)}] -- finds information about transaction. Returns \emph{LogState} which can be one of: \begin{enumerate*} 
		\item \code{Committed} -- when transaction has been committed
		\item \code{Rolled_back} -- when transaction has been rolled back
		\item \code{Unknown} -- when transaction with given id hasnâ€™t been added to a log yet
		\end{enumerate*} 
\end{description}
The log stores information off memory, in dedicated table, in order to preserve information about transaction after it is removed from \emph{Transaction Index}.
