\section{Transaction Log}
\label{sec:mpp:transactionLog}
\emph{Transaction Log} denoted, as \txLog is a local data structure present at each \node{i}$\in\text{\nodes}$. Its responsibility is to record committed and rolled back transactions. \txIndex changes frequently, because transactions are registered in it and removed on commit and rollback. Since \txIndex is the only way to find \paxosRoundId and transactions are removed from index once are finished, we need a log that has information whether transaction was committed or not. \txLog has to support the following operations:
\begin{description}
\item[\code{addAsCommitted (transaction id)}] -- record a committed transaction
\item[\code{addAsRolledBack (transaction id)}] -- record a rolled back transaction
\item[\code{findTransaction(transaction id)}] -- finds information about a transaction. Returns \emph{LogState} which can be one of: \begin{enumerate*} 
		\item \code{Committed} -- when transaction was committed,
		\item \code{Rolled_back} -- when transaction was rolled back,
		\item \code{Unknown} -- when transaction is missing in the log
		\end{enumerate*} 
\end{description}
