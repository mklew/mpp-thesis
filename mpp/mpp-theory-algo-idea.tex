Multi partition transactions algorithm (\mpt) uses \paxos, and leverages the distributed consensus with other techniques presented in this chapter to provide multi partition transactions with read-committed isolation level.

%TODO nie pisać o tym, że rozszerzam Paxosa tylko, że używam go.
%\mpt also relies on \paxos, but with pieces added and changed, thus extended
%\paxos is part of the \mpt algorithm. As a consequence, \mpt has to adhere to \paxos requirements in addition to requirements which are defined for transaction like behaviour.
