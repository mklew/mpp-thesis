\subsection{The idea}
Algorithm “MPPaxos” is designed for all distributed databases that share token ring architecture. 

MPPaxos provides serializable transactions that span multiple tokens on token ring. Provides transactions which are isolated from each other. Transactions that are atomic and durable. 
Consistency is eventual for all nodes, but reads are always consistent as long as quorum of nodes is considered. This is the same as in LWT.
